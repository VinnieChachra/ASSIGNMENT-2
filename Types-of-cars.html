        <p>SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle): An SUV is a car that is designed for off-road capabilities and provides more
            space and versatility than a traditional car. SUVs are available in a variety of sizes, from compact to
            full-size, and can be configured with two or four-wheel drive. </p>

        <p>Hatchback: A hatchback is a car that has a rear door that opens upwards, creating a large storage area.
            Hatchbacks are often smaller and more compact than sedans, making them a popular choice for city driving.
        </p>

        <p>Sedan: A sedan is a traditional four-door car that is designed for daily transportation. They usually have a
            trunk for storage and are available in a variety of sizes and styles.</p>

        <p>Coupe: A coupe is a two-door car that is designed for sportier driving. They typically have a lower and
            sleeker profile than sedans and often feature more powerful engines.

        <p>Convertible: A convertible is a car that has a retractable roof, allowing the driver and passengers to enjoy
            open-air driving. Convertibles are available in a variety of styles, including hardtop and soft-top.</p>
